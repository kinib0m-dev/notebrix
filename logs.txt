PROJECT LOGS - NoteBrix Implementation

=== PHASE 0: Subject-Based Context with Zustand ===
Date: 2025-07-26
Prompt: "Let's start the implementation of this project, I've already set up next js, the auth system, and initialised trpc. If you have any questions about the implementation of phase 0: Create the subject based context using zustand, ask them before proceding with the code."

Technical Description: Implementing subject-based context management using Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence. The system will manage the current selected subject and provide a foundation for the hierarchical learning structure (Subject → Topic → Subtopic → Concept).

Implementation Strategy:
1. Database Schema: Add subjects table with fields for id, userId, name, description, userEvaluation, color, isArchived, createdAt, updatedAt
2. Zustand Store: Create subject store with current subject state, subjects array, loading states, and persistence
3. tRPC Procedures: Implement create, getAll, getById, update, archive, delete procedures
4. React Hooks: Create hooks for easy access to subject procedures
5. TypeScript Types: Define comprehensive types for subject-related data structures

=== ENHANCED FILE UPLOAD SYSTEM WITH CHUNKING & EMBEDDINGS ===
Date: 2025-07-28
Prompt: "i've deleted the eextractor and re done it becuase it wasn't working. We are not going to process the images, diagrams, etc of the documents. The current file extractor just extracts the content. We need to modify the file or add to it so we can chunk the content per 1000 tokens or per paragraph so we will have a better semantic search later.I've also created the file embedding.ts it has the function to generate embeddings."
