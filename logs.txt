PROJECT LOGS - NoteBrix Implementation

=== PHASE 0: Subject-Based Context with Zustand ===
Date: 2025-07-26
Prompt: "Let's start the implementation of this project, I've already set up next js, the auth system, and initialised trpc. If you have any questions about the implementation of phase 0: Create the subject based context using zustand, ask them before proceding with the code."

Technical Description: Implementing subject-based context management using Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence. The system will manage the current selected subject and provide a foundation for the hierarchical learning structure (Subject → Topic → Subtopic → Concept).

Implementation Strategy:
1. Database Schema: Add subjects table with fields for id, userId, name, description, userEvaluation, color, isArchived, createdAt, updatedAt
2. Zustand Store: Create subject store with current subject state, subjects array, loading states, and persistence
3. tRPC Procedures: Implement create, getAll, getById, update, archive, delete procedures
4. React Hooks: Create hooks for easy access to subject procedures
5. TypeScript Types: Define comprehensive types for subject-related data structures

=== ENHANCED FILE EXTRACTION WITH GEMINI INTEGRATION & SMART CHUNKING ===
Date: 2025-07-27
Prompt: "For the file extractor, it currently extracts the content of the files, that is good, what I want to also add is for the fileExtractor when it encounters an image, diagram, etc in the file I want it to be sent to gemini so it returns description of the figure and we can store it with the content of the file. No file storage, just its content. For storage, I want to store chunks (max 1000 tokens) but respective paragraphs in the content, for better RAG pipeline and better outputs."
