PROJECT LOGS - NoteBrix Implementation

=== PHASE 0: Subject-Based Context with Zustand ===
Date: 2025-07-26
Prompt: "Let's start the implementation of this project, I've already set up next js, the auth system, and initialised trpc. If you have any questions about the implementation of phase 0: Create the subject based context using zustand, ask them before proceding with the code."

Technical Description: Implementing subject-based context management using Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence. The system will manage the current selected subject and provide a foundation for the hierarchical learning structure (Subject → Topic → Subtopic → Concept).

Implementation Strategy:
1. Database Schema: Add subjects table with fields for id, userId, name, description, userEvaluation, color, isArchived, createdAt, updatedAt
2. Zustand Store: Create subject store with current subject state, subjects array, loading states, and persistence
3. tRPC Procedures: Implement create, getAll, getById, update, archive, delete procedures
4. React Hooks: Create hooks for easy access to subject procedures
5. TypeScript Types: Define comprehensive types for subject-related data structures

=== Actions Performed ===

1. DATABASE SCHEMA IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Created subjects table in db/schema.ts with all required fields
   - Added proper indexes for performance (userId, name, createdAt, isArchived)
   - Used UUID for primary key and proper foreign key relationship to users table
   - Set up default values and constraints

2. TYPESCRIPT TYPES:
   - Created lib/subjects/types/index.d.ts with comprehensive type definitions
   - Defined Subject interface, UserEvaluation type, and store interfaces
   - Added predefined color constants for subject visual differentiation
   - Separated state and actions interfaces for better organization

3. VALIDATION SCHEMAS:
   - Created lib/subjects/validation/schemas.ts with Zod validation
   - Implemented validation for create, update, get, archive, and delete operations
   - Added proper constraints (name length, description length, color validation)
   - Exported inferred types for type safety

4. SERVER PROCEDURES:
   - Created lib/subjects/server/procedures.ts with complete tRPC router
   - Implemented all CRUD operations: create, getAll, getById, update, archive, delete
   - Added proper error handling and user ownership validation
   - Included archived subjects retrieval for future archive management

5. ZUSTAND STORE:
   - Created lib/subjects/store/useSubjectStore.ts with persistent store
   - Implemented state management for current subject and subjects array
   - Added loading states for all operations (creating, updating, deleting)
   - Configured localStorage persistence with proper serialization for Date objects
   - Used Immer middleware for immutable state updates

6. REACT HOOKS:
   - Created lib/subjects/hooks/useSubjects.ts for primary subject management
   - Implemented optimistic updates and error handling
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback
   - Created lib/subjects/hooks/useSubjectActions.ts for navigation and complex actions

7. UTILITY FUNCTIONS:
   - Created lib/subjects/utils/helpers.ts with comprehensive helper functions
   - Added color utilities, sorting, filtering, and validation helpers
   - Implemented date formatting and unique name generation
   - Added contrast color calculation for accessibility

8. TRPC INTEGRATION:
   - Updated main tRPC router to include subjects router
   - Ensured proper type safety across the entire stack
