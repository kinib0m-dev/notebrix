PROJECT LOGS - NoteBrix Implementation

=== PHASE 0: Subject-Based Context with Zustand ===
Date: 2025-07-26
Prompt: "Let's start the implementation of this project, I've already set up next js, the auth system, and initialised trpc. If you have any questions about the implementation of phase 0: Create the subject based context using zustand, ask them before proceding with the code."

Technical Description: Implementing subject-based context management using Zustand for state management with localStorage persistence. The system will manage the current selected subject and provide a foundation for the hierarchical learning structure (Subject → Topic → Subtopic → Concept).

Implementation Strategy:
1. Database Schema: Add subjects table with fields for id, userId, name, description, userEvaluation, color, isArchived, createdAt, updatedAt
2. Zustand Store: Create subject store with current subject state, subjects array, loading states, and persistence
3. tRPC Procedures: Implement create, getAll, getById, update, archive, delete procedures
4. React Hooks: Create hooks for easy access to subject procedures
5. TypeScript Types: Define comprehensive types for subject-related data structures
